# BHP Net Tool

A python based tool, made while I'm walking through the book Black Hat Python in order to have something that works as a different version of netcat.

## Project Status

At the present moment, the project is in construction, so inside the master branch, you will find only a Hello World. If you would like to see what exactly I'm doing now, select the development branch :)
